\opening{Dear Visa Office:}
 
I believe that this study plan, also submitted as an application for a student visa to study in Canadaâ€™s University of Waterloo, can provide you with an outline of my plan for one year of undergraduate study in Canada and my subsequent career development in China. I look forward to my application being assessed and approved at your earliest convenience.

\section{Personal status}

I am the applicant Jian Li, male, 21 years old, born in Beijing. To realize my dream of becoming an researcher in computer science, I choose Computer Science as my major in Nanjing University. As a junior, I work hard and won some awards in my major. After I learned some information about the exchange program between University of Waterloo and Nanjing University, I decided to take this chance for my better development. Therefore, I am applying to study at University of Waterloo in Canada for one year, from September 2013 to July 2014. 

\section{The reasons I wish to study at Computer Science, University of Waterloo, Canada}
